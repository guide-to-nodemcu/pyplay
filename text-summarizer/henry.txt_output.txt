Maggie Toole, on account of her dull eyes, broad mouth and left- handed style of footwork in the twostep, went to the dances with Anna McCarty and her "fellow."Anna and Jimmy were among the first Clover Leafs to arrive that evening.They viewed, then, genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle.Terry O'Sullivan was a victorious Prince Charming, and Maggie Toole winged her first butterfly flight.The Clover Leaf young men, after two years of blindness, suddenly perceived charms in Miss Toole.He wore a dress suit, and could chin the bar twice with one hand."Big Mike" looked carefully at the dancers, smiled, shook his head and departed.Some fine instinct that Rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to turn and look at them--there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena.Two or three Give and Takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer."I live on Grand," said O'Sullivan, insolently; "and no trouble to find me at home."As a rule," went on Dempsey, huskily sweet, "O'Sullivans in this district know one another.You escorted one of our lady members here, and we want chance to make good.He held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea had struck him.He made a quick movement, but Andy Geoghan was ready and caught his arm.But Maggie was off, darting her zig-zag way through the maze of dancers.There was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks, down which slow tears were running."I knew it, Dempsey," she said, as her eyes grew dull even in their tears.I hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin'.I knew there'd be nothin' doin' for him if he came as a Dago.It was remarkable how quickly Maggie's eyes could change from dull to a shining brown.
